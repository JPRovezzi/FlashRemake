# FlashRemake

FlashRemake is a web-based remake of the original FlashCalc Excel sheet. This project aims to provide the same functionality as the Excel version but in a more accessible and user-friendly web format.

## Purpose

FlashRemake is designed to perform flash calculations, which are essential in chemical engineering. Flash calculations determine the equilibrium state of a liquid and vapor mixture when it is subjected to a change in pressure or temperature. These calculations are crucial for designing and operating equipment like distillation columns, evaporators, and flash drums.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For implementing the core functionality and interactivity.
- **Python**: For backend processing (if applicable).
